# Dice-Counting

## Description

This MATLAB script is designed to count the number of dice in a given image, report the number of each type of die (1-6), and calculate the total number of dots on all the dice in the image. The script uses image processing techniques to detect and analyze dice patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* MATLAB: You need MATLAB installed on your computer to run this script.
  * If you do not have MATLAB installed on your system, you can check out the steps <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html?s_tid=hp_products_matlab">here</a>.

* Input Images: Prepare the input images that contain the dice you want to analyze. Supported image formats include JPEG, PNG, and others.
  * The darker your background is in comparison to your dice, the better segmentation this particular script can achieve for you.
  * For example: The images I was working with images that looked something like this:
    

## Usage

1. Clone or Download the Repository: Clone the repository containing the MATLAB script to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file and extract its contents.

```bash
```

2. Prepare Input Images: Place your input image files in the same directory as the script. Alternatively, you can specify the file paths within the script.

Run the Script: Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the script. Run the script by typing the following command in the MATLAB command window, replacing 'your_image.jpg' with the path to your input image file:
